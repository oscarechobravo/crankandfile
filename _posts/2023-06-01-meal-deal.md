# Meal Deal - A Gig Economy Courier Card Game

*What does it look and feel like to be in the saddle, with a bag full of hot food on your back, as your traverse city highrises looking for the address of customer? What is the financial impact of waiting around all day for work that never comes? Is it worth pushing your luck and taking a risk if it makes the difference in wages?*

The lived expereinces of cycle couriers are often invisible to consumers. Their needs can sidelined by app-developers who focus on the customer experience rather than that of the worker.

Meal Deal invites players to share some of the experiences that gig economy cycle couriers face. When we say gig economy courier we mean workers who access work through platforms like Deliveroo or UberEats and deliver food, medicine, and other consumer goods on their bicycles.

## About 

Meal Deal is a game that puts players in the saddles of cycle couriers working in the gig economy. With a finite amount of stamina on tap each day, the cards allow players to weave their own gig economy story expanding on research with couriers who've worked in Manchester, York and Edinburgh in the UK as part of the [Switch-Gig](https://switchgig.wordpress.com/) and [FlipGig](http://www.flipgig.org/) research projects.
