# Critical Tea Towels

*What do couriers experience when collecting and delivering orders? Are people thinking about the gig worker perspective when designing cities, policies, apps and platforms?*

## About 

![Inspirational tea towels](/assets/img/rad-teatowels.jpg){: width="auto" width="100%"}

Inspired by our favourite radical tea towels, union banners, and worker's rights movements as well as tea towels depicting tourist destinations the Critical Tea Towels explore what cities look like when we emphasise the experiences and views of the worker.


## The process

Data and concepts gathered and synthesised by Oliver Bates, Ben Kirman, and Carolynne Lord as part of the [Switch-Gig](https://switchgig.wordpress.com/) and [FlipGig](http://www.flipgig.org/) research projects. Our data was gathered through co-design workshops and interviews with gig workers. These research projects both looked to bring out the voices and experiences of workers who are treated as invisible infrastructure in the day-to-day lives of many. 

From our research we selected a number of key messages and anecdotes, drawing out a range of courier experiences. We worked closely with an illustrator to iterate the look and feel of the experiences.
