The booklet is a high quality printable booklet of provocative designs developed by the research team and designer. These designs are contextualised by the ridersâ€™ experiences and have iterated in light of feedback from our advisory board of Cooperatives UK, Miralis Data and Future City Logistics.

These provocations are artefacts that should be considered as exhibits, emphasising the voices of gig economy couriers in such a way that challenges the perception of them by the public and policy makers.
